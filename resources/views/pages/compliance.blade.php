Claims Legal Ltd are regulated by the claims management regulator in respect of regulated

claims management activities.

<p id="contentme" style="color:red">It is a criminal offense to work in this sector without proper authorisation.</p>
<p id="contentme">
The ‘Claims Management Regulation Unit’ is a division of the Ministry of Justice, and

ultimately gives all rules and procedures for claims management companies who they

authorise. Rules and Compliance come from a whole range of specific industry rules that

run alongside all other regulatory requirements and laws of the land.
</p>

<p id="contentme">
The Claims Management Regulator also monitor firms, carry out audit inspections and deal

with illegal and non-compliant practice by authorised and unauthorised firms and

individuals.
</p>

<p id="contentme">
We respect our regulator, our license and the position of authority and trust bestowed in us

as license holders.
</p>
<p id="contentme">
	Claims management companies have had some bad press over the years, and bad news

always travels quicker and faster than good news, but as an ever increasing choice by

many consumers, and the ever changing legal world, claims management is here to stay

for the foreseeable future. What will change is the professionalism of firms as the regulator

and Legal Ombudsman regulate firms a lot closer and take more action against those who

break the rules.
